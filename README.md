# GDP and Life Expectancy: An Exploratory Analysis
In this project, I explored data from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to analyze the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across six countries.

The goal was to understand how economic growth correlates with the health and longevity of populations in different regions. To do this, I:
* Cleaned and prepared the data
* Performed exploratory data analysis
* Visualized trends and comparisons using various plots

This analysis helped me draw meaningful conclusions about the connection between wealth and health.

Feel free to explore the notebooks, visuals, and resultsâ€”and share your thoughts or feedback in the Discussions section!
