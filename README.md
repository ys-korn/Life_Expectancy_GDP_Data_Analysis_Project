# GDP and Life Expectancy: An Exploratory Analysis

In this project, I explored data from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to analyze the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across six countries.

The goal was to understand how economic growth correlates with the health and longevity of populations in different regions. To do this, I:

- Prepared the data
- Performed exploratory data analysis
- Visualized trends and comparisons using various plots

## My Conclusion

As you go through the analysis, I will try to show you that although some data shows that life expectancy and GDP have an overall positive correlation, this appears to be primarily due to both metrics increasing over time. When looking at the data by country, there is no clear trend between life expectancy and GDP; the GDP trends within each country are not reflected proportionally in life expectancy trends.

The only country showing a clearer relationship is Zimbabwe, which has both GDP and life expectancy much lower than the others.

We can conclude that as long as a country has an annual GDP at least equal to Chile—and is not facing political, economic, or healthcare crises—its life expectancy is likely to be between 70 and 80 years. If a country is undergoing a crisis like Zimbabwe, this can significantly impact both GDP and life expectancy.

In all cases, life expectancy tends to grow every year alongside GDP. However, GDP alone does not appear to be a reliable predictor of life expectancy.

## Afterword

Although I stand by this conclusion, it is important to note that this analysis only covers six countries. With more data, different patterns may emerge.

Another valuable metric would be population size during the timeline to study GDP per capita, which may provide a better basis for comparison. Other factors worth exploring could include:

- Annual healthcare budget
- Obesity rates
- Crime rates
- Additional social and economic indicators affecting health outcomes
